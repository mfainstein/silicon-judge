# Silicon-Judge

**Silicon-Judge** is a tool that combines the capabilities of multiple large language models (LLMs) to provide informed predictions and judgments on a wide array of topics. It is inspired by the principles found in "Superforecasters" and "Noise", focusing on accurate, unbiased insights by synthesizing the strengths of diverse LLMs with the concept of "wisdom of the crowds" and professional judgment.

## Background

The platform is influenced by the idea that a diverse collection of independent judgments can, under the right conditions, outperform the insights of isolated experts. This concept, often referred to as the "wisdom of the crowds," suggests that aggregate predictions from a wide range of sources can lead to more accurate outcomes. Silicon-Judge integrates this principle with the analytical power of LLMs, aiming to combine the depth of professional judgment with the breadth of collective intelligence.

## Features

- **Integration of LLMs:** Draws on several large language models to encompass a broad spectrum of insights.
- **Versatility in Topics:** Equipped to handle discussions on anything from market dynamics to societal trends.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Seeks to neutralize individual biases through the aggregation of diverse model outputs, aligning with the "wisdom of the crowds" philosophy.
- **User Simplicity:** Designed for ease of use, enabling straightforward submission of queries and receipt of analyses.

## Structure

The project is structured around key TypeScript files, each serving a distinct purpose:

- `index.ts`: Manages interactions between users and models.
- `measure.ts`: Ensures prediction measurements are consistent and comparable.
- `measurement.ts`: Defines how measurement data is stored and handled.
- `model.ts`: Facilitates the interaction with LLMs and the integration of their outputs.
- `population.ts`: Collects data points from models, reflecting a microcosm of collective intelligence.
- `scale.ts`: Scales predictions for consistent evaluation across various scenarios.
- `summary.ts`: Compiles and presents summaries of the aggregated model data, making it accessible to users.
