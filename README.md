# Silicon-Judge

**Silicon-Judge** combines the insights of multiple large language models (LLMs) to offer predictions and judgments across a broad range of topics. It leverages the collective intelligence principle alongside professional judgment, aiming for unbiased and accurate insights by utilizing the diverse strengths of LLMs.

## Background

Silicon-Judge seeks to optimize decision-making through the aggregation of diverse LLM insights, guided by the principles outlined in "Superforecasters" and "Noise." This approach advocates for leveraging collective intelligence over individual expert analysis, integrating the analytical depth of LLMs to produce a balanced synthesis of expert insights and broad-based predictions.

## Features

- **Comprehensive LLM Integration:** Ensures a broad spectrum of insights by utilizing a variety of large language models.
- **Flexible Topic Coverage:** Equipped to generate insights on an extensive range of subjects, from market trends to societal dynamics.
- **Bias Reduction:** Mitigates individual biases through the aggregation of model outputs, embracing the wisdom of the crowds.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Simplifies interactions, making it easy for users to request and receive information.

## Core Components

The Silicon-Judge platform consists of several key TypeScript files:

- `index.ts`: Facilitates user interactions and manages the overall workflow of the platform.
- `measure.ts`: Defines the framework for quantifying predictions and judgments, ensuring that outcomes from different populations of LLM judges are standardized and comparable.
- `measurement.ts`: Handles the collection and documentation of outputs from specific populations of LLM judges, applying the standardization criteria to produce structured, comparable insights.
- `model.ts`: Coordinates the input and integration of outputs from multiple LLMs.
- `population.ts`: Describes the "population object," detailing the collective of LLM judges, including their distribution and management for particular measurements.
- `scale.ts`: Provides mechanisms for adjusting the scope and scale of predictions for uniform analysis across different contexts.
- `summary.ts`: Compiles the outputs into accessible summaries for users, synthesizing diverse model insights.
